# C++ Mini Snippets
This repository contains mini, basic C++ projects that I did in my spare time.

In this repository you will find the following:
- A calculator application.
- A parking charges application.
- A payroll application (basic)

These snippets were created by me during the first half of 2021 for practice purposes.
